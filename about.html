          <br><p>Letsoho la Ts'epo, which translates to Hand of Hope is a non-profit making organization run by youngstrs dedicated to helping senior citizens, particularly in Lesotho.
    <br />We as young people believe that there is still much life within the elderly, and we aim at cherishing that and learning from them in the process.</p>
    <p>And they need to know,<b><i>they are not alone</i></b></p>
    <div class="shading"><p>We aid in simple everyday activities that have become more of an effort to these senior citizens. We clean their homes, we help keep fresh water, we provide food and sometimes help them cook. Morover, we work on their gardens and for those that making
    ends meet is a struggle; we intervene. Some of these senior citizens care for their grandchildren; too little to do anything, and in such conditions we provide clothes, food, even school uniform for these little ones.<br>
  Our main goal is to leave an on-going permanent effect in the lives of the elderly by sharing some skills on how to make more out of what they have such as growing vegetables fpr profit.</p></div>
  <p>Our mission is to build a community of young people that treasures the old.<br>
  Our mission is to take the old out of soltitude by building a Letsoho La Ts'epo old age home, it will be one of it's kind.<br>
Our mission is to have our country's service system pumped up enough to have senior citizens accounted for.<br>
Our vision is making old age prerogative and effortless!</p><br>
